## My process

### Built with

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- SCSS (with BEM)

### What I learned

I learned to use Vue by creating a dropdown menu.

### Continued development

I want to improve my abilities using and exploring all the options available on Vue.js. In this project in particular, I want to learn how to make a transition of the menu when appearing.

### Useful resources

- [Vue Tutorials (in Spanish)](https://www.example.com) - When I started this project I did not know almost nothing about Vue.js, so I started by watching some videos of this list made by GOGODEV.
